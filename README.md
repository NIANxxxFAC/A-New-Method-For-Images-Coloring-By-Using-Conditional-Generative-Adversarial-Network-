# A-New-Method-For-Images-Coloring-By-Using-Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Network-

Abstract

This new invention presents a method for coloring black-and-white films and photos in real time by using conditional Generative Adversarial Network(cGAN). Using the YUV channel instead of RGB channel to train the network makes the training more effective. The cGAN which is made up of a "U-Net"-based architecture for generator and a convolutional "PatchGAN" classifier avoids shortages of traditional encoder-decoder models.
